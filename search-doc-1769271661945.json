It exposes a function to add players to groups and a function to remove players from groups.  Basic usage looks like this:  local exampleGroup = QuickBounds.createGroup() local zone = QuickBounds.createZoneFromInstance(workspace.ExampleZone) zone:watchGroups(exampleGroup) game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player) PlayerAddon.addPlayerToGroups(player, exampleGroup) end) exampleGroup:onEntered(function(rootPart, zone, player) print(player.Name, &quot;entered zone&quot;, zone.part) end) exampleGroup:onExited(function(rootPart, zone, player) print(player.Name, &quot;exited zone&quot;, zone.part) end)   Cleanup when players leave is done automatically, so you don't need to manually remove the player from all groups when the player leaves.  If you want to use this addon with StreamingEnabled on the Client then you have to set the player characters to Persistent on the server.

A zone is just simple geometry, it knows it's own shape, size and cframe. You can create a zone in one of two ways: Either by manually passing the cframe, size and shape or by creating the zone based on an instance. Every Roblox BasePart shape but Half Wedge is supported.

Each group should ideally embody a particular aspect of your game logic - for example a safezone, quest triggers, traps and so on.  The relationship between zones and groups is many to many, meaning any number of zones can watch any number of groups. When a zone starts watching a group, the group will be notified if any of its associated BaseParts enter this zone.

So groups with a lower priority value get prioritized over groups with a higher priority value, groups at the same priority can coexist without interferring with one another.  The above snippet is equivalent to this:  local group = QuickBounds.createGroup() group:setPriority(10)   When no priority is passed during group creation, it defaults to 100'000.

The first parameter for the callback is the BasePart that interacted with the group, while the second is the specific zone object that the BasePart has entered. If the zone was created via createZoneFromInstance then it will also have a &quot;part&quot; field that can be accessed. The third parameter is the custom data that may or may not have been specified while adding a BasePart to the group, if you want a practical example of custom data in use then check out the Player Addon under the Addons tab.
